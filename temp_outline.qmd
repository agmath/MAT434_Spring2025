This document just contains an outline for what we'll do today.

## Code Chunk Options

Show `include`, `message`, `echo`, `code-fold`...

## Inline R

Show how to print out the number of rows and columns using inline R. Try using it throughout!

## Skimming Data

Show `head()`, `glimpse()`, and `{skimr}`'s `skim()` function to gain some high-level insights into the MLB data

## Split the Data

Obtain *training* and *test* sets

## Investigate the Training Data

Before doing meaningful analysis I'll show how to use `filter()` and `select()` and then students will direct the questions we investigate.

Be sure to show `mutate()`, `summarize()`, and `group_by()`

Reiterate on all changes being temporary unless items are explicitly stored
